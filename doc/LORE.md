The world did not end overnight.

## Timeline

- 20 years in the past: Scientists manage to access another dimension, the Nether.
  They bring back a sample.
  Unbeknownst to them, a grave threat slithers with that into this world: The blob.
  As soon as it gains access to the world, it begins infecting it.
- 15 years ago: Some animals display strange mutations, plants are dying. Crops are failing.
  The situation is apparent now, but the cold war keeps on smoldering.
  A seed of paranoia has been planted when the cold war originally began and the blob influence
  is making it sprout, resulting in the three superpowers accusing each other of causing the
  effects of the blob.
- 3 years ago: The blob-caused ecological problems worsen and it has become known that these
  are happening on a worldwide scale.
  Winter came and went, but a lot of the trees stayed bare.
  There were crop failures; Some sort of pesticide had ruined the soil, they said.
  It sure didn't help with the invasive locusts. The weather got worse, the bugs got bigger, and things got weirder.
- 2 years ago: Supplies begin to dwindle.
  People are posting online about missing family members, cryptids and lights in the sky.
  They say a whole town disappeared out west.
  Some guys in unmarked vans cordoned it off. It was in the news one day, and the next it wasn't.
  Tensions between the 3 superpowers are heightened.
- 1 year ago: The headlines flew by so fast that society just got numb to the fact that the whole world was slowly losing its mind.
- 6 months ago: Fueled by blob psychosis and egregious goods shortages, riots start happening.
- 3 months ago: The riots worsen as food and other goods are already very scarce.
  People rise up and fight against the police, leading to riot control as well as police bots being deployed everywhere.
- 1 month ago: Insurgencies happen and militias are formed, which continue clashing with police forces.
  Rhode island declares secession. Independent rebel groups pop up, their militias claiming land and warring against each other,
  competing for precious supplies and committing atrocities.
- 3 weeks ago: Blob saturation reaches a critical level, leading to humans and big enough other animals reanimating.
- 2 weeks ago: The tensions and wars escalate. Atomic bombs are being used.
  As the skies are seared by atomic fire, and the atmosphere is dense with psychic echoes screaming in terror, reality is torn apart.
  Gateways to the Nether appear, some straight up swallowing nukes that are still on route.
  Untold horrors emerge, from giant, eldritch kaijus to barely visible, lurking nightmares.
  The vast majority of people have no to very little memories of this event,
  their brains being rended by the supernatural and unable to comprehend the shattered reality.
- Today: Start of game. Due to atomic weapons being used and other weather anomalies, winters are harsher.
