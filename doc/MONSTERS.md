`all`              | The default value for all fields, if nothing more specific is provided.
`physical`         | The default value for physical damage types (`bash`, `cut`, `stab`, `acid`, and `bullet`)
`non_physical`     | The default value for non-physical damage types (`biological`, `heat`, `cold`, and `electric`)
